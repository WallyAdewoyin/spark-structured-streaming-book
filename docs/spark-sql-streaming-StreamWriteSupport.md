== [[StreamWriteSupport]] StreamWriteSupport Contract -- Writable Streaming Data Sources

`StreamWriteSupport` is the <<contract, abstraction>> of <<implementations, DataSourceV2 sinks>> that <<createStreamWriter, create StreamWriters>> for streaming write (when used in streaming queries in <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.md#, MicroBatchExecution>> and <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.md#, ContinuousExecution>>).

[[contract]][[createStreamWriter]]
[source, java]
----
StreamWriter createStreamWriter(
  String queryId,
  StructType schema,
  OutputMode mode,
  DataSourceOptions options)
----

`createStreamWriter` creates a <<spark-sql-streaming-StreamWriter.md#, StreamWriter>> for streaming write and is used when the [stream execution thread for a streaming query](StreamExecution.md#queryExecutionThread) is [started](StreamExecution.md#start) and requests the stream execution engines to start, i.e.

* `ContinuousExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-ContinuousExecution.md#runContinuous, runContinuous>>

* `MicroBatchExecution` is requested to <<spark-sql-streaming-MicroBatchExecution.md#runBatch, run a single streaming batch>>
