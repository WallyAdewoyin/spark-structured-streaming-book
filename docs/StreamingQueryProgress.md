# StreamingQueryProgress

`StreamingQueryProgress` holds information about the progress of a streaming query.

`StreamingQueryProgress` is created exclusively when `StreamExecution` is requested to [finish a trigger](ProgressReporter.md#finishTrigger).

[NOTE]
====
Use spark-sql-streaming-StreamingQuery.md#lastProgress[lastProgress] property of a `StreamingQuery` to access the most recent `StreamingQueryProgress` update.
